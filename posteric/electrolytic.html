        <p>
            Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors known for their high capacitance-to-volume ratio. They use an electrolyte (a conductive liquid or gel) as one of the plates and are typically used in circuits where large amounts of charge storage are needed, such as in power supply filtering, energy storage, and coupling/decoupling applications. Due to their polarization, electrolytic capacitors must be connected with the correct polarity to avoid damage. They are available in two primary types: aluminum and tantalum, with aluminum being the most common.

            Part Number Example<br>
            Nichicon UVZ1H101MPD<br>
            Capacitance: 100µF<br>
            Voltage: 50V<br>
            Tolerance: ±20%<br>
            Type: Radial Leaded Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor<br>
            Temperature Range: -40°C to +105°C<br>
            <b>Specifications</b><br>
            Capacitance Range: From a few microfarads (µF) to thousands of µF, depending on application needs.<br>
            Voltage Rating: Typically ranges from 6.3V to 500V for aluminum electrolytic capacitors and up to 100V for tantalum.<br>
            Tolerance: Typically ±20%, with some variants offering ±10%.<br>
            Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR): Higher than ceramic capacitors, ranging from milliohms to ohms, which can affect their performance at high frequencies.<br>
            Leakage Current: Electrolytic capacitors exhibit a small but measurable leakage current.<br>
            Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to +85°C or +105°C, with high-temperature versions available that operate up to +125°C.<br>
            Polarization: Electrolytic capacitors are polarized and must be connected with the correct polarity (positive to positive, negative to negative) to avoid failure.<br>
            <b>Military and Industrial Standards</b><br>
            <b>Military Standards:</b><br>
            MIL-PRF-39018: U.S. military specification for fixed aluminum electrolytic capacitors (polarized).<br>
            MIL-PRF-123: Defines reliability and performance standards for tantalum electrolytic capacitors.<br>
            MIL-STD-202: Testing standard for environmental and mechanical conditions for various capacitors, including electrolytic types.<br>
            <b>Industrial Standards:</b><br>
            AEC-Q200: Reliability standard for automotive-grade electrolytic capacitors, ensuring they perform well in harsh automotive environments.<br>

            <b>Packaging Types</b><br>
            Radial Leaded: The most common form for aluminum electrolytic capacitors, where both leads come out from the bottom. Suitable for through-hole mounting on PCBs.<br>
            
            Axial Leaded: Electrolytic capacitors with leads coming out from opposite ends, used in situations requiring sturdy mechanical placement or in legacy designs.<br>
            
            Surface-Mount Device (SMD): Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are often available in SMD packages for automated assembly processes in compact designs like mobile devices, computers, and automotive electronics.
            <br>
            Snap-in: Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors with leads designed to "snap in" to the PCB, typically used in power supplies, motor drives, and industrial electronics.
            <br>
            Screw Terminal: High-voltage or high-capacitance electrolytic capacitors used in industrial power supplies, inverters, and energy storage systems, with screw terminals for secure connections.
            <br>
            Tape and Reel: Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are commonly supplied in tape and reel packaging for automated pick-and-place machines in high-volume manufacturing.
            <br>
            Bulk Packaging: For general use, capacitors are provided in bags or boxes, often for hand assembly in prototyping or smaller-scale production runs.
            <br><br>
            Electrolytic capacitors are critical components in circuits that require large capacitance values, such as filtering or energy storage applications, and are widely used in consumer, industrial, and military electronics. Their high capacitance, however, comes with some trade-offs in terms of ESR, leakage current, and a need for proper polarity connection.
