            Low-power operational amplifiers are designed specifically for applications where energy efficiency is crucial, such as battery-operated devices, portable electronics, and energy-sensitive systems. These op-amps operate with reduced power consumption while maintaining acceptable performance levels for a variety of tasks, including amplification, filtering, and signal conditioning.<br>

Low-power op-amps typically feature lower supply voltage requirements and optimized designs that minimize quiescent current without significantly compromising performance parameters like gain, bandwidth, and noise. They are particularly beneficial in applications that prioritize longer battery life and lower heat generation.

SOIC (Small Outline Integrated Circuit):

A surface-mount package that is smaller and allows for denser PCB layouts compared to DIP packages.
Example: TLV2372 available in SOIC-8.<br>
TSSOP (Thin Shrink Small Outline Package):

A thinner version of the SOIC that provides even more compact designs, suitable for high-density applications.
Example: TLV2372 available in TSSOP-8.<br>
MSOP (Micro Small Outline Package):

A compact surface-mount package for applications where space is limited, commonly used in low-power designs.
Example: TLV2372 in MSOP-8 configuration.<br>
