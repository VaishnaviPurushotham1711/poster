        <p>
            A carbon film resistor is a type of fixed resistor where a thin layer of carbon is deposited on a ceramic substrate. This carbon layer acts as the resistive element, and the value of resistance is determined by the thickness of the carbon film and the length of the spiral cuts made on the film. Carbon film resistors are commonly used in general-purpose electronic applications due to their relatively low cost, good stability, and low noise compared to carbon composition resistors. They offer better performance in terms of tolerance, temperature coefficient, and stability.
<br>
Carbon film resistors are ideal for applications that require a stable resistance value over time and a better temperature coefficient than carbon composition resistors but do not require the precision of metal film resistors.
<br>
Part Number Example<br>
CF14JT100K (Yageo Carbon Film Resistor)<br>
Resistance Value: 100kΩ<br>
Power Rating: ¼ Watt (0.25W)<br>
Tolerance: ±5%<br>
Temperature Coefficient: ±200 ppm/°C<br>
Voltage Rating: 350V<br>
Operating Temperature Range: -55°C to +155°C<br>
Package Type: Axial leaded<br>
<b>Specifications</b><br>
Resistance Range: Typically from 1Ω to 10MΩ. Carbon film resistors cover a wide range of resistance values for general-purpose applications.<br>
Power Rating: Common power ratings include 1/8 watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt, 1 watt, and 2 watts.
Tolerance: Standard tolerances are usually ±1%, ±2%, or ±5%, which makes them suitable for applications that require moderate precision.<br>
Temperature Coefficient: The resistance change with temperature is generally around ±200 ppm/°C, making carbon film resistors more stable than carbon composition types but less stable than metal film resistors.
Voltage Rating: Maximum operating voltage typically ranges from 200V to 500V, depending on the power rating and size of the resistor.<br>
Noise: Carbon film resistors produce less noise than carbon composition resistors, which makes them more suitable for low-noise applications.<br>
<b>Military and Industrial Standards</b><br>
<b>Military Standards:</b><br>

MIL-R-39008: Governs the performance and reliability of fixed carbon film resistors used in military applications, ensuring they meet environmental and electrical performance requirements.<br>
MIL-PRF-39017: Covers the specifications for fixed resistors, including carbon film resistors, for high-reliability military systems.<br>
MIL-STD-202: Defines various environmental, electrical, and mechanical tests to ensure reliability under extreme conditions like vibration, moisture, and temperature variation.<br>
<b>Industrial Standards:</b><br>

IEC 60062: Covers marking codes for resistors, including carbon film types.<br>
JEDEC Standards: Sets guidelines for testing and performance requirements for resistors used in industrial electronics.<br>
RoHS & REACH Compliance: Ensures that the resistors are free from hazardous materials, following regulations for environmental safety and sustainability.<br>
<b>Packaging Types</b><br>
Axial Leaded Package: The most common package type for carbon film resistors. The cylindrical body has leads extending from either end, suitable for through-hole mounting in printed circuit boards (PCBs).<br>
Sizes: Available in various sizes depending on the power rating (e.g., 1/8 watt, 1/4 watt, 1/2 watt).<br>
Surface Mount (SMT) Package: Although less common for carbon film resistors compared to other types like metal film resistors, some surface mount packages are available for specific applications.<br>
SMD Sizes: Common SMD packages for resistors include 0805, 0603, and 1206 sizes for compact designs.<br>

Carbon film resistors offer an excellent balance between cost, performance, and stability, making them ideal for many general-purpose applications. They are an improvement over carbon composition resistors in terms of noise, tolerance, and temperature stability, though they are not as precise as metal film resistors. Carbon film resistors are used in a wide range of electronic circuits, including power supplies, amplifiers, and household devices. Understanding their specifications and standards ensures optimal performance and reliability in both consumer and industrial applications.
