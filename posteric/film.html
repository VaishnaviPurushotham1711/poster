        <h1>Film capacitor</h1>

            Film capacitors, also known as polymer film capacitors, are non-polarized capacitors that use a thin plastic film as the dielectric. They are known for their excellent reliability, stability, and low dielectric loss, making them suitable for precision applications, especially in AC circuits, power supplies, and audio systems. Film capacitors are available in various types depending on the film material (e.g., polyester, polypropylene), and they offer high insulation resistance, good temperature stability, and long operational life.<br>

Part Number Example<br>
WIMA MKP10 1.0/400/10<br>
Capacitance: 1µF<br>
Voltage: 400V<br>
Tolerance: ±10%<br>
Type: Metallized Polypropylene (MKP)<br>
Temperature Range: -55°C to +105°C<br>
Package Type: Radial<br>
<b>Specifications</b><br>
Capacitance Range: From a few picofarads (pF) to several microfarads (µF), typically 0.001µF to 100µF.<br>
Voltage Rating: Common ratings from 50V to 2000V, with high-voltage versions available for specific applications.<br>
Tolerance: Ranges from ±1% to ±20%, with high-precision variants available.<br>
Dielectric Materials: Common types include:<br>
Polyester (PET): General-purpose capacitors, known for good temperature stability and high capacitance per volume.<br>
Polypropylene (PP): Excellent for high-frequency and high-voltage applications due to low dielectric loss and good thermal stability.<br>
Polystyrene (PS): Used for precision and low-loss applications, though less common due to temperature sensitivity.<br>
ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance): Very low ESR, typically in the milliohm range, making film capacitors suitable for high-frequency circuits.<br>
Operating Temperature Range: Typically from -55°C to +125°C, depending on the dielectric material.<br>
Self-Healing Property: Many film capacitors are "self-healing," meaning that small defects in the dielectric layer can automatically repair themselves by evaporating the metallization at the point of breakdown.<br>
<b>Military and Industrial Standards</b><br>
<b>Military Standards:</b><br>
MIL-PRF-19978: U.S. military standard for fixed, plastic (film) dielectric capacitors, covering performance and reliability for general and high-reliability applications.<br>
MIL-PRF-55514: Specifies the requirements for fixed, metallized plastic film capacitors for military use.<br>
MIL-STD-202: Governs testing methods for environmental, mechanical, and electrical characteristics of capacitors, including film types.<br>
<b>Industrial Standards:</b><br>
IEC 60384-2: Specifies fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment, covering film capacitors' safety, reliability, and performance.<br>
UL 94: This standard is applied to film capacitor housings to ensure the flame retardancy of the plastic materials used.<br>
EIA RS-469: A U.S. standard defining mechanical and electrical specifications for film capacitors.<br>
<b>Packaging Types</b><br>
Radial Leaded: The most common packaging type for film capacitors, where leads extend from the bottom of the component. These capacitors are often coated with epoxy resin and are suitable for through-hole mounting on PCBs.
<br>
Axial Leaded: In this configuration, the capacitor's leads extend from either end, making them useful for circuits requiring linear placement. Axial film capacitors are often found in high-reliability and legacy designs, especially in power and automotive applications.
<br>
Surface Mount Device (SMD): Less common for film capacitors but available in specialized designs where space-saving is critical. SMD film capacitors are used in certain compact circuits where their high performance is needed in smaller packaging.
<br>
Box-Type Film Capacitors: These are rectangular capacitors in box-shaped casings with radial leads, commonly used in AC line filtering, interference suppression, and motor run/start applications.
<br>
Tape and Reel: Film capacitors supplied in tape and reel form for automated pick-and-place machines in high-volume production environments.
<br>
Bulk Packaging: For general-purpose usage, film capacitors are supplied in bags or boxes, ideal for hand assembly or prototyping.
<br>
<br>
Film capacitors are crucial in applications requiring high performance, stability, and reliability, from audio systems to industrial power equipment and military electronics. Their versatility in handling high voltages and frequencies makes them a preferred choice for many critical circuits.
