        <p>
            A Darlington Transistor is a semiconductor device that combines two bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in a single package to achieve high current gain. The configuration allows a small input current to control a much larger output current, making it highly effective for applications requiring significant amplification. The Darlington pair can be either discrete transistors connected together or a single integrated component. Due to their high current gain, Darlington transistors are widely used in applications such as switching circuits, amplifiers, and motor drivers.<br>

Part Number Example<br>
TIP120 (NPN Darlington Transistor)<br>
Collector-Emitter Voltage (Vce): 60V<br>
Collector Current (Ic): 5A<br>
Power Dissipation (Pd): 65W<br>
Current Gain (hFE): 1000 (minimum)<br>
Base-Emitter Voltage (Vbe): 1.2V (typical)<br>
Package Type: TO-220<br>
Operating Temperature Range: -55°C to +150°C<br>
<b>Specifications</b><br>
Collector-Emitter Voltage (Vce): The maximum voltage that can be applied between the collector and emitter terminals, which typically ranges from 30V to 120V depending on the transistor.<br>
Collector Current (Ic): The maximum current that the transistor can handle, usually from a few hundred milliamps to several amps.<br>
Power Dissipation (Pd): Maximum power that the transistor can dissipate without overheating. Values vary but often range from 1W to 100W.<br>
Current Gain (hFE or β): The ratio of output current (collector current) to input current (base current). Darlington pairs typically exhibit very high current gain, often exceeding 1000.<br>
Saturation Voltage (Vce(sat)): The voltage drop between the collector and emitter when the transistor is fully on, typically around 1V to 2V for Darlington transistors.<br>
Base-Emitter Voltage (Vbe): The voltage required to turn on the transistor, typically around 1.2V to 2.5V for Darlington configurations.<br>
Operating Frequency: Darlington transistors have slower switching speeds compared to standard BJTs due to their higher gain, usually suitable for frequencies up to a few hundred kHz.<br>
