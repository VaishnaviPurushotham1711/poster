        <p>
            A wirewound resistor is a type of fixed resistor that uses a metallic wire (usually nichrome, manganin, or other alloys) wound around a non-conductive ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The resistance is determined by the material and length of the wire. Wirewound resistors are known for their high accuracy, durability, and ability to handle high power levels and temperatures. They are used in applications that require precise resistance values and high stability, such as power supplies, current sensing, and industrial equipment.
<br>
Wirewound resistors are popular in both high-power and precision low-power applications due to their ability to handle higher currents and provide better heat dissipation compared to other resistor types.
<br>
Part Number Example<br>
W22-100RJI (Ohmite Wirewound Resistor)<br>
Resistance Value: 100Ω<br>
Power Rating: 10W<br>
Tolerance: ±5%<br>
Temperature Coefficient: ±20 ppm/°C<br>
Package Type: Axial, through-hole<br>
Specifications<br>
Resistance Range: Typically ranges from 0.01Ω to several hundred kilohms, depending on the application and power rating.<br>
Power Rating: Common power ratings for wirewound resistors include 1W, 5W, 10W, 25W, and higher, with some models capable of handling up to 100W or more.<br>
Tolerance: Wirewound resistors typically offer very tight tolerances, often as low as ±0.1%, but more commonly in the range of ±1% to ±5%.<br>
Temperature Coefficient: Wirewound resistors exhibit very low temperature coefficients (±20 ppm/°C to ±100 ppm/°C), meaning their resistance value remains stable over a wide temperature range.<br>
Inductance: Due to the coiled nature of the wire, wirewound resistors can have inductance, which may be an issue in high-frequency circuits. Non-inductive wirewound resistors are available to overcome this limitation.<br>
Operating Temperature Range: Typically from -55°C to +350°C, making them suitable for high-temperature environments.<br>
Surge Capability: Wirewound resistors can handle high surge currents, making them useful for inrush current limiting and energy dissipation in high-power circuits.<br>
Military and Industrial Standards<br>
Military Standards:<br>

MIL-PRF-26: Covers the requirements for fixed resistors, including wirewound resistors, ensuring performance under various environmental and electrical conditions for military applications.<br>
MIL-STD-202: Provides standardized methods for testing the environmental and mechanical endurance of wirewound resistors, including temperature, vibration, and shock testing.<br>
MIL-R-39009: Defines reliability, stability, and electrical performance characteristics for wirewound resistors used in military and aerospace systems.<br>
Industrial Standards:<br>

IEC 60115-1: Specifies the general requirements for fixed resistors, including wirewound types, covering their electrical and mechanical performance.<br>
JEDEC Standards: Ensures wirewound resistors meet industrial performance, thermal management, and quality requirements.<br>
RoHS & REACH Compliance: Ensures wirewound resistors are free from hazardous substances, adhering to environmental regulations for safety and sustainability.<br>
Packaging Types<br>
Wirewound resistors come in a variety of packaging types depending on their intended power rating and mounting method:<br>

Axial Leaded:

The most common packaging for wirewound resistors, featuring a cylindrical body with leads extending from both ends. These are used in through-hole mounting applications and are often coated with a protective enamel or cement.
Power Ratings: Available in power ratings from 1W to 25W or more, with sizes increasing as power rating increases.
Surface Mount (SMD):
<br>
Wirewound resistors are also available in surface-mount designs for automated production processes. These are typically low-power resistors but can still handle significant amounts of current compared to other resistor types.
SMD Sizes: Common sizes include 2512 and 2010, used in compact, high-power applications.<br>
Chassis-Mount / Heat-Sinkable:

Designed for high-power applications, these wirewound resistors come in aluminum or ceramic cases for mounting to heat sinks, helping to dissipate large amounts of heat generated by high currents.
Power Ratings: Often used in applications requiring 50W to several hundred watts, such as industrial motor drives or power distribution systems.<br>
Cement/Power Resistor:

Wirewound resistors often come encased in cement or ceramic to protect the wire winding and dissipate heat. These are used in high-power and harsh environments like motor control or power regulation systems.<br>

<br>
Wirewound resistors are robust, high-power, and precision components designed for applications requiring high stability and accuracy. Their ability to handle high currents, low temperature coefficient, and surge capabilities make them indispensable in industrial, military, and high-power electronic systems. Available in various packaging types, including through-hole, surface-mount, and heat-sinkable options, wirewound resistors meet stringent military and industrial standards for performance and reliability in demanding environments.
