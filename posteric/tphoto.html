        <p>
            A phototransistor is a type of transistor that operates based on light exposure. It functions similarly to a regular transistor, but instead of using electrical signals at the base terminal to control current flow, it uses light. When exposed to light, the phototransistor allows current to flow between its collector and emitter, amplifying the light-induced current. Phototransistors are widely used in light-sensing applications such as optocouplers, light meters, infrared receivers, and object detection systems.<br>

Phototransistors offer higher sensitivity to light than photodiodes and are often used in applications that require amplification of light signals without needing an external amplifier.
<br>
Part Number Example<br>
BPW77NB (Vishay Phototransistor)<br>
Type: NPN silicon phototransistor<br>
Wavelength Sensitivity: 550nm (visible light)<br>
Collector-Emitter Voltage (V<sub>CEO</sub>): 70V<br>
Collector Current (I<sub>C</sub>): 50mA<br>
Dark Current: 100nA<br>
Package Type: Through-hole (T-1 ¾)<br>
Specifications<br>
Type: Available in NPN and PNP configurations, where NPN is more common.<br>
Spectral Sensitivity: Phototransistors are sensitive to light in the visible and infrared spectrum, typically between 400nm and 1100nm. Some are optimized for specific wavelengths, such as IR-sensitive types.<br>
Collector-Emitter Voltage (V<sub>CEO</sub>): The maximum voltage that can be applied across the collector and emitter, usually ranging from 20V to 100V.<br>
Collector Current (I<sub>C</sub>): The maximum current that flows through the collector when the transistor is fully illuminated, typically ranging from 20mA to 100mA.<br>
Rise and Fall Time: Phototransistors have slower response times compared to photodiodes, with typical rise and fall times of a few microseconds to tens of microseconds, depending on the design.<br>
Dark Current: The small amount of current that flows through the phototransistor when no light is present, typically in the nanoampere range.<br>
Operating Temperature Range: Phototransistors generally operate within -40°C to +100°C, depending on the manufacturer and intended application.<br>
Military and Industrial Standards<br>
Military Standards:<br>

MIL-STD-883: Defines reliability and performance standards for microelectronic devices, including phototransistors, for military and aerospace applications.<br>
MIL-STD-750: Covers environmental and electrical testing methods for semiconductor devices, including phototransistors, ensuring they perform under extreme conditions.<br>
MIL-PRF-19500: Specifies performance requirements for semiconductor components used in military systems, including phototransistors, ensuring durability in high-stress environments.<br>
Industrial Standards:<br>

IEC 60747: Provides international standards for discrete semiconductor devices, including phototransistors, covering their testing, performance, and reliability requirements.<br>
JEDEC Standards: Governs the testing and qualification processes for phototransistors in industrial applications, ensuring consistent quality.<br>
RoHS & REACH Compliance: Ensures phototransistors are manufactured without harmful substances, adhering to environmental safety regulations.<br>
Packaging Types<br>
Phototransistors come in various package types depending on the application and form factor:<br>

Through-Hole Packages:

T-1 (3mm) and T-1 ¾ (5mm): Commonly used cylindrical packages for through-hole mounting. These packages are widely used in optoelectronic circuits, especially for sensing and infrared applications.
TO-18 Package: A metal can package used for high-reliability applications, often seen in military and industrial applications due to its durability.
Surface Mount Packages (SMD):
<br>
SMD Packages: These are compact packages designed for automated assembly in modern electronics. Common sizes include 0805 and 1206, which are ideal for space-constrained applications.<br>
Photointerrupters/Modules: Some phototransistors are packaged together with a light source (like an LED) in an integrated module, used for object detection, encoders, or optocouplers.<br>
Custom Modules: Phototransistors are also available as part of more complex assemblies, such as in optoisolators or infrared detection systems, where they are paired with emitters or lenses to enhance performance.
<br>
<br>
Phototransistors are essential components for detecting light and converting it into an amplified electrical signal. They offer higher sensitivity than photodiodes and are versatile in a variety of sensing applications, from remote control systems to industrial automation. Available in multiple packages and meeting strict military and industrial standards, phototransistors ensure reliability and performance across a broad range of environmental conditions and applications.
