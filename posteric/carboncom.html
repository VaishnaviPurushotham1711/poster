            A carbon composition resistor is an early type of resistor made from a mixture of carbon powder and a binder, formed into a cylindrical shape. These resistors have relatively high energy absorption capabilities, making them suitable for applications where high voltage pulses or power surges occur. However, they have lower accuracy, higher noise, and worse stability over time compared to newer types of resistors like metal film or carbon film resistors. They are primarily used in high-energy applications, such as power supplies, surge protectors, and RF circuits.
<br>
Due to advancements in technology, carbon composition resistors are less commonly used today but are still available for specialized applications requiring pulse tolerance or in vintage electronics repair.
<br>
Part Number Example<br>
CCR05CG100JR (Vishay Carbon Composition Resistor)<br>
Resistance Value: 10Ω<br>
Power Rating: 0.5W (½ watt)<br>
Tolerance: ±5%<br>
Voltage Rating: 350V<br>
Temperature Coefficient: ±700 ppm/°C<br>
Operating Temperature Range: -55°C to +150°C<br>
Package Type: Axial leaded<br>
<b>Specifications</b><br>
Resistance Range: Typically from a few ohms to several megaohms (e.g., 1Ω to 22MΩ).<br>
Power Rating: Common power ratings are ¼ watt, ½ watt, 1 watt, and 2 watts. Higher wattage resistors can dissipate more heat without being damaged.<br>
Tolerance: Carbon composition resistors generally have a wider tolerance, typically between ±5% and ±20%, which means the actual resistance can vary significantly from the nominal value.<br>
Temperature Coefficient: This specifies how much the resistance changes with temperature. Carbon composition resistors typically have a high temperature coefficient, around ±700 ppm/°C.<br>
Voltage Rating: The maximum voltage that can be safely applied to the resistor without breakdown, often ranging between 250V and 500V.<br>
Pulse Tolerance: Carbon composition resistors can handle high-energy pulses better than film resistors, which is a key reason they are used in high-voltage or surge protection circuits.<br>
<b>Military and Industrial Standards<br>
    Military Standards:
    </b>
MIL-PRF-39007: Defines performance, quality, and reliability requirements for fixed carbon composition resistors for military applications.<br>
MIL-R-11: Covers specifications for fixed carbon composition resistors used in military and aerospace applications, including environmental, electrical, and mechanical performance.<br>
MIL-STD-202: Establishes environmental testing methods to ensure the resistors can withstand harsh conditions like temperature cycling, shock, and vibration.<br>
<b>Industrial Standards:</b><br>

IEC 60062: Specifies marking codes for resistors, including carbon composition types.<br>
JEDEC Standard No. 22: Defines testing procedures for electronic components, including carbon composition resistors, to ensure they meet industrial requirements.<br>
RoHS & REACH Compliance: Ensures carbon composition resistors are free from hazardous substances, adhering to environmental safety regulations.<br>
<b>Packaging Types</b><br>
Axial Leaded Package: The most common package type for carbon composition resistors. The leads are attached at either end of the cylindrical body, making them ideal for through-hole mounting in printed circuit boards (PCBs).<br>
Dimensions: Typically come in standard sizes such as ¼ watt, ½ watt, and 1-watt packages. The physical size increases with power rating.<br>
<br>
Carbon composition resistors, though largely replaced by modern resistor types, are still valued in specific applications for their high energy absorption, ability to withstand power surges, and rugged performance. Their wider tolerance, higher noise, and instability over time make them less suited for precision applications but useful in high-pulse or high-voltage circuits. Understanding their specifications and limitations is crucial when selecting them for military, industrial, or specialty applications.
