            A metal film resistor is a type of fixed resistor in which a thin layer of metal, typically nickel-chromium (NiCr), is deposited onto a ceramic rod. The metal film is precisely cut in a helical pattern to adjust the resistance value. Metal film resistors are known for their accuracy, stability, low noise, and low temperature coefficient, making them suitable for precision applications such as instrumentation, measuring devices, and high-performance audio systems. They offer better tolerance and long-term stability compared to carbon film and carbon composition resistors.<br>
